<h1 id="first-time-playing">First time playing</h1>

<p>The first time you play can be a little exciting and also nerve-wracking. Generally, being reasonable and flexible is what’s expected at all times. This will serve you well.</p>

<h2 id="court">Court</h2>

<p>Choosing a facility that has reservations for court (as opposed to a public park), is <strong>strongly recommended</strong>. This ensures the match will place at the scheduled time and there will be no random interferences in the courts, delays, etc.</p>

<p>For best-of-3 sets, it’s typically recommended to reserve a court for 2 hours.</p>

<h2 id="shared-court-fees">Shared court fees</h2>

<p>The rule is to <strong>always</strong> check with your opponent ahead of time.</p>

<p>If the facility has fees to reserve courts, both players should split the fees evenly.</p>

<p>Some locations have free entrance for members and guests. If that is your case, ask your guest to come in with you, or ask your opponent to see how their home court facility works.</p>

<p>Some facilities have cheaper rates for residents, in that case, the resident player can pay for both and split the fees immediately after.</p>

<h2 id="new-tennis-balls">New Tennis Balls</h2>

<p>If you are the home player, you supply a new can of balls to play.</p>

<p>Some people like to warm-up with other balls and start with fresh balls. Others prefer to start by warming up with the fresh balls.</p>

<h2 id="match-time">Match Time</h2>

<p>The match warm-up with your opponent starts as close as possible to the agreed-upon start time.</p>

<p>Get to the location sooner ahead of this time to allow for your own warm up ahead of the agreed match time.</p>

<p>If this is your away game, check with your opponent about location, parking, etc. and make sure you plan your arrival with enough time prepare and do any warming up before warming up before the match on court.</p>

<h2 id="warming-up">Warming Up</h2>

<p>Warming up is important to make sure you do not injure yourself. It’s also necessary to play at your best.</p>

<p>There are two parts to the warm-up. First is your <em>own warm-up</em>, then it’s the <em>on-court warm-up</em> prior to the match, with your opponent.</p>

<p>Arrive with enough time to do your own warm up as much as you feel you need to.</p>

<p>Some locations may have a wall to hit prior to the match, or an area to run, or jump rope, or some empty court you can use.</p>

<p>Check with your opponent ahead. Some people like 5 minute own warm-ups, some like 10 or 15 minutes or even more. Some people warm up quickly, others require longer to feel ready to play at their best.</p>

<p>The official rules in international tennis about warm-up is 5 minutes prior to the match. More than that is only reasonable if both you and your opponent agree. As always, be flexible and courteous.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-scores">Reporting Scores</h2>

<p>After the match, anyone of the players can report the scores by going to the schedule page and reporting it (last column). Once the score is reported, players in the league get a confirmation by email.</p>

<p>If there was a mistake, you or your opponent can post corrections to the score for a brief while after the score is posted.</p>
