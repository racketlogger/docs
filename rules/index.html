<h2 id="racketlogger-rules">RacketLogger Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You are expected to abide by the <a href="rules-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.</li>
  <li>You have to make all calls on your side, help your opponent make calls when the opponent requests it, and to call against yourself (with the exception of the first service) any ball that you clearly see out on your opponent’s side of the net.</li>
  <li>Any “out” or “let” call must be made instantaneously (i.e., made before either an opponent has hit the return or the return has gone out of play); otherwise, the ball continues in play.</li>
  <li>Do not enlist the aid of spectators in making line calls.</li>
  <li>If you call a ball out and then realize it was good, you should correct your call as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>To avoid controversy over the score, the <em>server</em> should announce the set score (e.g., 5-4) before starting a game and the game score (e.g., 30-40) prior to serving each point.</li>
  <li>If players cannot agree on the score, they may go back to the last score on which there was agreement and resume play from that point, or they may spin a racket.</li>
  <li>Foot faults are not allowed to be called, unless they are blatant. If your opponent persists in foot-faulting after being warned not to do so, please rate your opponent negatively.</li>
  <li>Wait until the players on another court have completed a point before retrieving or returning a ball. Try not to cross their court.</li>
  <li>Honor your commitment to play at the time/place you agreed. Exceptions should occur only in cases of serious illness, injury or personal emergency.</li>
  <li>From the beginning of the match, play must be continuous, with some flexibility. Rate negatively your opponent(s) if they attempt to stall or extend rest periods for recovering from a loss of physical condition (such as cramps or shortness of breath).</li>
  <li>Intentional distractions that interfere with your opponent’s concentration or efforts to play the ball are against the rules.</li>
  <li>Spectators, including parents, friends and coaches, are welcome to watch and enjoy the matches. Their role, however, is clearly restricted to that of passive observer, with no involvement of any kind during the match.</li>
  <li>You are expected to put forth a full and honest effort regardless of the score or expected outcome.</li>
  <li>Players are expected to maintain full control over their emotions and the resulting behavior throughout the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to play your best tennis! Notice what you need to improve, and practice to improve for more fun on the court!</p>

<h2 id="general-rules-for-play">General Rules for Play</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Above all, courteous, respectful match behavior</li>
  <li>You arrange matches with your opponent at a convenient time for both in the location of home player’s court</li>
  <li>Court fees, if any, should be equally shared between the players</li>
  <li>The home player is responsible for providing a fresh can of balls for match play</li>
  <li>If the league does not reach enough players, you will be refunded the league fee</li>
  <li>You play a regular season of 5 to 7 games, typically once a week, on your time, with an extra week of wiggle room</li>
  <li>Players receive a RacketLogger rating</li>
  <li>If a player does not arrive on time, the other player can claim a “walk” win after 30 minutes</li>
  <li>The top players with the most points in the league advance to the Playoffs (draw format, if there is quorum)</li>
  <li>The winner and finalist of the playoffs gets a prize</li>
  <li>Players with a rating above 6.0 (subject to change), or that reach the final, advance to the next level up in the following season</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="match-format">Match Format</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Matches are played in a best-of-three sets format.</li>
  <li>Scores are kept for each match and submitted to RacketLogger for the league standings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="third-sets-tie-breaks">Third Sets, tie-breaks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For leagues <em>3.0 level and below</em>, the home player can opt, at the beginning of the match, and <em>not later</em> (unless the opponent agrees) to a full third set if it comes to that. Alternatively, the home player may choose to play a tie-break game to best to 7 (or 10) points, with difference of two instead of the third set. In any case, the third set should be reported as 7-6.</li>
  <li>For everyone else, if the score reaches 6-6, the third set should be ended by playing a 10-point tie-break and reported as 7-6.</li>
  <li>In this case, if <em>both players agree before going past 6-6</em>, the game may be played either to a 7-point tie-break or indefinitely to a difference-of-two matches, e.g. 10-8 (reported accurately, e.g. as “10-8”).</li>
</ul>
