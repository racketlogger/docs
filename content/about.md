## Overview

The RacketLogger site was originally developed to keep track (to *log*) tennis rackets and strings. For that, we developed a database of [string specs](http://www.racketlogger.com/string) and [racket specs](http://www.racketlogger.com/racket).

## Developer API

We are interested in developing an API for other apps to produce innovative uses of our site. Check [API documentation](api/) page for the details. Email support to get an API key!
