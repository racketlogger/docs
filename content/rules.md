## RacketLogger Rules

The RacketLogger league rules are meant to engage and keep reliable tennis players, that show up to matches, have fun playing their best tennis game, and bring in a little competitive edge!

* Schedules will be created suggesting a week for matches to be played. Matches can be played any time agreed upon by both players (or both doubles pairs). All matches should be completed and scores entered by the Season End Date for the program. Most leagues will schedule an extra week to complete all matches. Defaults should not be recorded until end of league season unless a player or doubles team has cancelled twice once a day/time has been confirmed. It is understood that some players may be unavailable during part of the season but planning to play more matches toward the end of the season.  Any match where one player or doubles team attempted to schedule a day/time with opponents that remained unplayed at the end of the season should be recorded as a default by the player/doubles team that attempted to schedule the match.


## General Rules for League Play

* Above all, courteous, respectful match behavior
* You arrange matches with your opponent at a convenient time for both in the location of home player's court
* Court fees, if any, are equally shared between the players
* The home player provides a fresh can of balls for match play
* If the league does not reach enough players, you will be refunded the league fees
* You play a regular season of 5 to 7 games, typically once a week, on your time, with an extra week of wiggle room
* Winners accrue RacketLogger points and a rating
* If a player does not arrive on time, the other player can claim a "walk" win after 30 minutes
* The top players with the most points in the league advance to the Playoffs (draw format, if there is quorum)
* The winner and finalist of the playoffs gets a prize
* Players with a rating above 6.0 (subject to change), or that reach the final, advance to the next level up in the following season

## Match Format

* Matches are played in a best-of-three set format *for leagues 3.5 and above*
* For leagues *3.0 level and below*, the home player can opt, at the beginning of the match (*not later*, unless the opponent agrees) if a third set will be a tie-break game to best to 7, with difference of two.
* Scores are kept for each match and submitted to RacketLogger

## General Tennis Rules

Here is a relatively short PDF illustrated guide to [Tennis Rules](/pdf/Tennis-Rules-Illustrated.pdf) from the US Tennis Association.

3. The schedule will designate one player (pair) as "Home" –  Unless otherwise stipulated by local league guidelines, the home player is responsible for providing a can of new balls for the match, for booking a court if necessary, and for paying any court costs/guest fees. The home player is encouraged to select a mutually convenient match location in consultation with the other player. All matches should be played within the commonly accepted area of the local league.

4. It is recommended that the winner enter the scores for the match and the opponent confirms it is correct. Either player can enter scores. Only the Local Tennis Organizer can change a score that has been entered.
5. Scoring. The local league will choose a scoring method:
A. Best of three sets with a set tiebreak (first to 7 points by 2) at 6-6 in any set.
B. Match tiebreak in lieu of 3rd set (first to 10 points by 2). Set tiebreak (first to 7 points by 2) at 6-6 in first or second set.
C. Allow players to choose option A or option B for each match, or to determine a winner in an incomplete match as explained below. Preferably, players should decide on option A or option B before play begins.


If a winner is determined in an incomplete match: (the local league must authorize this format when setting up league).
Winner of the most games completed wins the match. Enter scores as played from winner’s perspective and enter as a completed match. If tied in games, winner of the first set is determined winner of the match.

Example: if Player A is winner and score entered is 6-4, 3-6, 3-1 (completed), Player A will receive the match win and will receive 12 games won for the match and 11 games lost while Player B will be credited for 11 games won and 12 games lost.

6. Play is self-regulated and disputes should be worked out by the players. It is recommended you read the Code for Unofficiated Matches to familiarize yourself with the rules of tennis. Check out our 2013 Friend at Court guide.

7. In leagues with multiple flights, a play-off could be scheduled between flight winners. The Local Tennis Organizer will let you know how a play-off would be scheduled. Local standings are determined by most matches won, then head to head results. If a double round robin is used, or head to head is tied for other reasons, then sets won, sets lost, games won, games lost are considered in order until the tie is broken.

8. Refunds and Transfers. Players may withdraw from a flight prior to the publication of the schedule and will receive a refund of the program fee minus the $3 non refundable registration processing fee.  If a flight does not get published due to lack of players,  the player has a choice to receive a refund of the program fee (minus $3 non refundable registration processing fee) or to request a transfer to the next season with the full registration fee.

9. Waiver of Claims. Players participating in the USTA Flex Leagues acknowledge the risks associated with playing competitive tennis, accept those risks voluntarily, and, in consideration of their acceptance in the Program, assume all risks for bodily injury, waive all claims for injury and property damage, and release and hold harmless the USTA and the host facility, their officials, employees, and agents with respect to any injury or loss caused by negligence or otherwise to the fullest extent permitted by law.
