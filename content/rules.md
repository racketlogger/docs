## RacketLogger Rules

* You are expected to abide by the [code of conduct](rules-of-conduct) at all times.
* You have to make all calls on your side, help your opponent make calls when the opponent requests it, and to call against yourself (with the exception of the first service) any ball that you clearly see out on your opponent’s side of the net.
* Any “out” or “let” call must be made instantaneously (i.e., made before either an opponent has hit the return or the return has gone out of play); otherwise, the ball continues in play.
* Do not enlist the aid of spectators in making line calls.
* If you call a ball out and then realize it was good, you should correct your call as soon as possible.
* To avoid controversy over the score, the *server* should announce the set score (e.g., 5-4) before starting a game and the game score (e.g., 30-40) prior to serving each point.
* If players cannot agree on the score, they may go back to the last score on which there was agreement and resume play from that point, or they may spin a racket.
* Foot faults are not allowed to be called, unless they are blatant. If your opponent persists in foot-faulting after being warned not to do so, please rate your opponent negatively.
* Wait until the players on another court have completed a point before retrieving or returning a ball. Try not to cross their court.
* Honor your commitment to play at the time/place you agreed. Exceptions should occur only in cases of serious illness, injury or personal emergency.
* From the beginning of the match, play must be continuous, with some flexibility. Rate negatively your opponent(s) if they attempt to stall or extend rest periods for recovering from a loss of physical condition (such as cramps or shortness of breath).
* Intentional distractions that interfere with your opponent’s concentration or efforts to play the ball are against the rules.
* Spectators, including parents, friends and coaches, are welcome to watch and enjoy the matches. Their role, however, is clearly restricted to that of passive observer, with no involvement of any kind during the match.
* You are expected to put forth a full and honest effort regardless of the score or expected outcome.
* Players are expected to maintain full control over their emotions and the resulting behavior throughout the match.
