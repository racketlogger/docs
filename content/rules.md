## RacketLogger Rules

The RacketLogger league rules are meant to engage and keep reliable tennis players, that show up to matches, have fun playing their best tennis game, and bring in a little competitive edge!

## General Rules for League Play

* Above all, courteous, respectful match behavior
* You arrange matches with your opponent at a convenient time for both in the location of home player's court
* Court fees, if any, are equally shared between the players
* The home player provides a fresh can of balls for match play
* If the league does not reach enough players, you will be refunded the league fees
* You play a regular season of 5 to 7 games, typically once a week, on your time, with an extra week of wiggle room
* Winners accrue RacketLogger points and a rating
* If a player does not arrive on time, the other player can claim a "walk" win after 30 minutes
* The top players with the most points in the league advance to the Playoffs (draw format, if there is quorum)
* The winner and finalist of the playoffs gets a prize
* Players with a rating above 6.0 (subject to change), or that reach the final, advance to the next level up in the following season

## Match Format

* Matches are played in a best-of-three set format *for leagues 3.5 and above*
* For leagues *3.0 level and below*, the home player can opt, at the beginning of the match (*not later*, unless the opponent agrees) if a third set will be a tie-break game to best to 7, with difference of two.
* Scores are kept for each match and submitted to RacketLogger
